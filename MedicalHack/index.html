<html><body><table><tr><td>There are scattered fibroglandular elements in both breasts</td><td>Breasts are made of fat and gland tissue. The amount of fat and gland tissue in the breast determines how the breast will look on a mammogram. The more gland tissue in a breast, the more white the breast appears on a mammogram. The amount of fat and gland tissue in the breast is graded from 1 to 4, all of which are normal. 1 means mostly fat tissue. 4 means mostly gland tissue. Your breast scores 2 which means that there is slightly more fat than gland tissue. This is normal.</td></tr><tr><td> There is possible architectural distortion in the left breast middle depth central to the nipple seen on the mediolateral oblique view only</td><td>On one picture of the left breast, there is possible disruption of the normal structure of breast tissue which can be a sign of cancer.</td></tr><tr><td> No other suspicious masses or calcifications are seen in either breast</td><td>There is nothing else in either of your breasts that we are worried about.</td></tr></table></body>
